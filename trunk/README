Directory structure:

fortran mode source code and Makefile in src directory.
python interface to spectral data files and sample plotting scripts in python directory.
model executable (gfs) put in bin directory by Makefile.
heldsuarez_test holds test data and scripts for Held-Suarez dycore test.

Prerequistes:  

a fortran compiler (tested with intel fortran and gnu fortran)
fftw3 FFT library (fftw.org)
*blazingly fast* shtns spherical harmonic lib (https://bitbucket.org/nschaeff/shtns/wiki/Home)

To build:

cd src; edit Makefile for your system.

for full gfs model, run
  make clean
  make libgfs
  make gfs (executable is bin/gfs)

for Held-Suarez and Jablonowsky-Williamson test, run
  make clean-test
  make gfs-test (executable is bin/gfs_test)

To test:

to run held-suarez test case, cd to heldsuarez_test directory and run test_gfs.
plot zonal mean zonal wind and temperature using python/plotzonalmean.py
compare resulting plots to zonalmeanu.png and zonalmeant.png.

to run jablonowski and williamson test case, cd to jablowill_test and run test_gfs.
plot surface pressure using python/plotps.py and compare resulting plot with ps.png
and figure 9 in paper (jablonowski and williamson (2006, QJR, p. 2943, doi: 10.1256/qj.06.12).
